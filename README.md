# Vidrieria - Personnel & Finance Manager

A personal side-project to build a **lightweight system** for personnel management and financial movements (absences, advances, transfers, etc.) in my family‚Äôs glass-workshop business.

This repo is my attempt to automate the basics while practicing **Python**, **SQLite**, creating a web interface with **Streamlit**, and more. The goal is to create a **functional MVP** that solves a real-world problem.
